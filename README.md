# Quizki Frontend
Quizki is a question and answer database which generates exams. This is the frontend of the project. For the backend go to [team-quizki/backend](https://github.com/team-quizki/quizki-backend).

This project was update to [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) version 8.3.20, and is now using Angular 8.

## Getting Started
Here is what you need to do to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dependencies
To run the frontend you will need to install the following tools, on your own, and before proceeding...
* Node Package Manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Angular Command Line Interface ([Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/))

### Installation
To get the frontend running on your local machine follow these steps.
  1. Fork quizki-frontend.git into your git remote account: `https://github.com/team-quizki/quizki-frontend.git`
  2. On your local machine create a folder to clone your forked copy into.
  3. From that folder's command line issue: `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-REMOTE/quizki-frontend.git`  
  4. Change to the quizki-frontend directory. `$ cd quizki-frontend`
  5. Run `npm install` to install packages and dependencies required by this Angular project `$ npm install`

If the above steps worked, you should be ready to serve the app.

## Development Server
Run `$ ng serve` for a dev server, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. You can also run `$ ng serve --open` to serve the app and open it in a new browser tab automatically. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If `$ ng serve` is not working run `$ npm link`, and then run `$ ng serve` again.

## Code Scaffolding
Run `$ ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `$ ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `$ ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running the Tests
We have a couple simple tests built.

### Running unit tests
Run `$ ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
Run `$ ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further Help

## Deployment
The project is not yet ready for deployment. We will add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system when it is ready.

## Built With
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
